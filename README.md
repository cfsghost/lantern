# Lantern

An isomorphic web application built with "Universal JavaScript" and modern technologies, which contains basic functionality, fundamental design and workable architecture. Good to be used to create your project quickly.

The architecture design was already done for isomorphic. The views and frontend stuffs which are implemented with React can be rendered on server-side and client-side both and using the same configuration of routes. The good news is, there is no need to learn anti-pattern flux framework(e.g., redux) for isomorphic. Lantern provided an easy way for developers who are already familar with flux pattern.

Besides, the callback hell are not there anymore. The generator is widely used in this project, which is the new technology in new version of ECMAScript(JavaScript) for flow control. The Backend is using generator with Koa web framework, and frontend is using generator in flux framework as well.

Not only technique things, but also UI design is pretty cool in Lantern project. The framework that Semantic UI bring us fantastic frontend user interface, even better than bootstrap and other UI framework.

## Documentation

See our [Wiki](https://github.com/cfsghost/lantern/wiki) for more information.

## Installation

In order to support ES6+ and using a lots of new technologies (ex, generator and classes), Node.js 0.12+ or io.js is required. Once you have such environment, you can start to install modules needed via NPM.

```
npm install .
```

Then you can use webpack to compile and combine all of frontend source code for service.
```
webpack
```

Finally, you can start this web service:
```
node app.js
```

## Development

Starting up in development mode is able to enable hot loading mechanism, you can start service with:
```
node app.js dev
```

## Run in Production

For production, all of JavaScript will be minimized and optimized with no debug messages and symbols. You should use specific configuration file:
```
webpack --config webpack.production.config.js
```

Then you can direct run app with environment variable like this:
```
NODE_ENV=production node app.js
```

If the PM2 you are using for production, just run it with `process.json` provided and `--env production` options.
```
pm2 start process.config.js --env production
```

## Efficient Server Rendering

Server rendering machanism of React is synchronous and slow against Node.js event-loop performance. It causes that reduces the number of concurrent connections for single process.

A implementation in Lantern architecture is individual renderer processes for server rendering of react. All of React rendering work is separated from main process to avoid blocking server. (The default number of renderer process is 2)


## Benchmarks

Testing for rendering page with React on server side.

Environment:
* Apple MacBook Pro Retina 2013 (i7 2.4 GHz/8GB RAM)
* 1 Node.js process
